Hey, I'm a research scientist at Netflix and a final year PhD student at the University of Bristol, UK. 

My PhD topic is in the field of video compression, more specifically, on deep learning-based adaptive resolution algorithms for improved compression efficiency. Check out my [publications](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/)!

At Netflix, I work on the Video Algorithms team, where we strive to provide the best possible video quality for our costumers.
